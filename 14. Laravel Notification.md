# Laravel Notifications

## Creating Notifications
```
php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid
```
*InvoicePaid is the name of notification if you want, you can change according to your needs.*


## Sending Notifications

### This is useful primarily when you need to send a notification to multiple notifiable entities such as a collection of users.To send notifications using the facade, pass all of the notifiable entities and the notification instance to the send method:

```
Notification::send($users, new InvoicePaid($invoice));
```
*$invoice is Data*


## On-Demand Notifications
### Sometimes you may need to send a notification to **someone who is not stored as a "user" of your application**. Using the Notification::route facade method, you may specify ad-hoc notification routing information before sending the notification:
```
Notification::route('mail', 'example@gmail.com')
			->->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));
```
*channel: mail and InvoicePaid is name of notification file name*

## Mail Notifications

### Formatting Mail Messages
#### If a notification supports being sent as an email, you should define a toMail method on the notification class.

```
public function toMail($notifiable)
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject("Your post successfully approved!")
                    ->greeting("Hello ". $this->post->user->name . "!")
                    ->line('Your post has been successfully approved.')
                    ->line('Post Title: '.$this->post->title)
                    ->action('View' , url(route("author.post.show", $this->post->id)))
                    ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }
```   

```
public function toMail($notifiable)
{
    $url = url('/invoice/'.$this->invoice->id);

    return (new MailMessage)
                ->greeting('Hello!')
                ->line('One of your invoices has been paid!')
                ->action('View Invoice', $url)
                ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
}

```
